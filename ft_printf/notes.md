### `%d` type

`-` flag overrides the `0` flag

`+` flag overrides the _`space character`_ flag

`.` _aka_ precision field overrides the `0` flag

if `.` _aka_ precision length is bigger than the input 
length, the rest is filled with _`0`'s_

else if `.` _aka_ presicion length is smaller than the 
input length, the input should be fully printed, without 
truncation

the `#` flag doesn't work with the `%d` type

### `%c` type

- `-` flag **does** work with the `%c` type
- the **width** flag **does** work with the `%c`

- `+` flag **doesn't** work with `%c` type
- `0` flag **doesn't** work with `%c` type
- `space` flag **doesn't** work with the `%c` type
- `.` flag **doesn't** work with the `%c` type
- `#` flag **doesn't** work with the `%c` type

### `%s` type

- `+` flag **doesn't** work with the `%s` type
- `0` flag **doe**




Don't forget to make a function that counts the number of chars in an `int` passed as argument.
